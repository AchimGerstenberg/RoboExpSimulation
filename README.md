# RoboExpSimulation

This repository includes the Unity scene and the codes for a mobile autonomous robot simulation that is useful to statistically enhance the quantitative results from a robot programming experiment conducted by Achim Gerstenberg at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 2017/18. The simulation can be fed with the codes written by the participants during the experiment and then simulates the according robot behavior and documents the results. By executing the codes under multiple different conditions the performance results can be evaluated statistically and deterministically.

The purpose of this repository is that other researchers can retrace and replicate the experiment and use the simulation as an analysis tool.
